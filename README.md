### Getting started with Gitlab
I was 45 mins late and I thought there'd have been a lot of commits already. Turns out I only missed creating a gitlab account and syncing it with Github. I was expecting Id have missed more. I think the larger size of the class is impacting our pace?

### Suggestions to be more efficient/ some things to iterate upon: Ready the agenda and materials before 5:45p. So that when we start, by 5:45p or after the grace period, everything is set and the class' workflow is efficient. Currently I noticed, our class doesnt usually start until 5:55 or 6pm and only then do we start readying/ typing the agenda on the screen and figuring out the best way to distribute materials etc
