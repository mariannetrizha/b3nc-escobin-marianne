### Getting started with Gitlab
####I was 45 mins late and I thought there'd have been a lot of commits already. Turns out I only missed creating a gitlab account and syncing it with Github. I was expecting Id have missed more. I think the larger size of the class is impacting our pace?

### Suggestions to be more efficient/ some things to iterate upon: Ready the agenda and materials before 5:45p. So that when we start, by 5:45p or after the grace period, everything is set and the class' workflow is efficient. Currently I noticed, our class doesnt usually start until 5:55 or 6pm and only then do we start readying/ typing the agenda on the screen and figuring out the best way to distribute materials etc. Sidenote: What I learned today: theres no one right answer, a developer might be able to come up with a faster way to develop the client's vision and that's ok.. even better in fact.

### Suggestion: test all the activity links on incognito before the class to save time :)

###A day in the life 
####Wew! Time flies by so fast :) 3rd week with Tuitt and looking good so far. I often come to class realllly tired with 4 hours of sleep average. After Tuitt, I head straight to work.. still tired. But all's good, I think Im getting the hang of it and I've never been so hesitant on missing a class until Tuitt! 

####2nd piece of feedback: I think itd help if the  functionalities of these new installations are explained esp if we decide to install sublime on our laptops.. And maybe a short overview of gitlab and how to use it maybe?
